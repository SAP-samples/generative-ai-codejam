With SAP AI Launchpad you can administer all your machine learning operations. You can connect different AI runtimes, such as SAP AI Core, SAP AI Services or HANA. You can also deploy a proxy for a large laguage or foundation model like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini 1.5 or many more. Make sure you have the extended plan of SAP AI Core to leverage generative AI hub. To connect SAP AI Core to SAP AI Launchpad you need the SAP AI Core service key.
