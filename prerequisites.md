# Prerequisites

There are hardware, software and service prerequisites for participating in this SAP CodeJam. 

The approach assumed for the participants is that exercises will be executed using [SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/sap-business-application-studio/what-is-sap-business-application-studio) as the development tool. 

If you are experienced in using Jupyter or Microsoft VSCode, then you could execute exercises locally on your own computer, but the setup for this is outside of the scope of this material.

# SAP Business Application Studio

## Hardware

* If attending an in-person SAP CodeJam, then bring your own laptop.

## Software

* A Chromium-based web browser, like Google Chrome, MS Edge, Vivaldi, Brave etc.
* Unfortunately there are some issues, when using a Firefox web browser.
