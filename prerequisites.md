# Prerequisites

There are hardware, software and service prerequisites for participating in this SAP CodeJam. 

The approach assumed for the participants is that exercises will be executed using [SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/sap-business-application-studio/what-is-sap-business-application-studio) as the development tool. 

If you are experienced in using Jupyter or Microsoft VSCode, then you could execute exercises locally on your own computer, but the setup for this is outside of the scope of this material.

# SAP Business Application Studio

## Hardware

* If attending an in-person SAP CodeJam, then bring your own laptop.

## Software

* A Chromium-based web browser, like Google Chrome, MS Edge, Vivaldi, Brave etc.
* Unfortunately there are some issues, when using a Firefox web browser.

## Services

You should have your own access to a subscription to the SAP Business Application Studio (BAS). 

If you do not have access to BAS in your organization's account (eg. of your employer or your university), then you can use one in either SAP BTP free trial (for individuals) or free tier (for organizations):

* Get a free SAP Business Technology Platform trial account, if you don't already have one:
